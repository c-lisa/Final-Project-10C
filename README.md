LITTLE HIPPO THE PILOT

AUTHOR Written by Lisa Chiang (clisa928@g.ucla.edu)

BACKGROUND This project was created to fulfill the final project requirement of the PIC10C course at UCLA. It was inspired by a childhood imaginary game that my younger brother and I used to play that centered around a stuffed animal named Little Hippo who was a pilot. He saved his fellow animal friends from the "bad guys." 

SYNOPSIS This one-player game consists of the player taking the role of the protagonist, Little Hippo. The player moves left and right using the arrow keys and shoots using the spacebar. The player begins with three lives. As the game progresses and the player accumulates more points, the difficulty of the game gradually increases. The game continues until the player has 0 lives left. 

The game is coded in C++ in Qt. The .pro files, .h files, .cpp files, .jpg, .mp3, .qrc files, .png files are all included in the repository. 

RELEVANCE TO THE COURSE: 

Lambda Functions 

   Example: 

   auto_inc_enemy_speed = [](int val){

      if(val>=25 && val&25 == 0) return true;

      else return false; 

   };
